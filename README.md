###Predicting Boston Housing Prices
This project is set up for the problem on predicting the selling prices of clients' houses, at the foundation of statistical analysis on a dataset of many houses in the region. 

Various features of houses and their corresponding prices are included in the dataset. Learning from the relationship between those features and prices, a model is built to predict future selling prices given specific features on houses of clients.
